# ⚡️ Avatar Lab – Where AI Meets Emotion

Welcome to **Avatar Lab** – the next generation of intelligent, emotionally expressive avatar animation. More than just lip-syncing, Avatar Lab combines powerful neural speech synthesis and state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate **realistic**, **emotion-aware avatars** that move, speak, and feel like real humans.

Whether you're building virtual assistants, game characters, or AI-driven content creators, Avatar Lab brings your digital personas to life.

## 🔬 Models we tried 

### 🗣️ Speech Synthesis Models

We use the most advanced TTS systems to generate high-quality, human-like speech:

- [**Coqui TTS**](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) – Fast, multilingual, expressive speech synthesis  
- [**Zonos TTS**](https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos) – Lightweight and customizable TTS engine  
- [**Bark TTS**](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark) – Zero-shot voice cloning and audio generation  
- [**Spark TTS**](https://github.com/SparkAudio/Spark-TTS) – Multilingual, high-quality TTS with multiple voices  

### 🎥 Diffusion-Based Facial Animation

These models power expressive facial motion, lip-sync, and emotional realism:

- [**DiffPoseTalker**](https://github.com/DiffPoseTalk/DiffPoseTalk/tree/main) – Diffusion-based facial animation from audio  
- [**Memo Avatar**](https://github.com/memoavatar/memo.git) – Memory-based personalized avatar synthesis  
- [**SadTalker**](https://github.com/OpenTalker/SadTalker) – Realistic facial animation guided by landmarks and audio  
- [**DiffTalk**](https://github.com/sstzal/DiffTalk) – Diffusion-powered speech-to-video avatar animation  
- [**LatentSync**](https://github.com/bytedance/LatentSync) – Audio-latent space sync for expressive talking heads

## 🆕 UPDATES

After evaluating several TTS and diffusion-based facial animation models, we finalized on the following two for **Avatar Lab**:

### 🗣️ Speech Synthesis Model: [Zonos TTS](https://github.com/Zyphra/Zonos)
We chose **Zonos TTS** for its lightweight architecture and natural, expressive voice synthesis.
